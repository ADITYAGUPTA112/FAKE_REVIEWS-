"I don’t usually write reviews, but Santoor Classic Gentle Hand Wash truly deserves a few words from the heart.From the very first pump, I was captivated by the warm, comforting fragrance of sandalwood. It reminds me of home — of calm evenings, tradition, and quiet moments. The addition of Tulsi adds a fresh, herbal note that feels grounding and pure. The scent lingers just long enough to feel luxurious, without being overpowering.The texture is silky and smooth, and just a small amount lathers beautifully. It leaves my hands not only clean, but genuinely soft and moisturized, which is such a relief in these times when we wash our hands constantly. Unlike many other hand washes that leave my skin dry or tight, Santoor feels nurturing — like it’s caring for my skin as much as it’s cleansing it.What I also appreciate is the subtle but meaningful sense of wellness it brings. Knowing it contains the natural goodness of sandalwood and Tulsi, ingredients deeply rooted in Indian tradition, makes it feel more than just a hand wash — it feels like a quiet ritual of self-care in the middle of a busy day.This has now become a staple in my home. It’s gentle enough for the whole family and effective enough to trust. If you're looking for a hand wash that blends tradition, care, and quality, this is it.Highly recommended. Heartfelt thanks to Santoor for creating something so simple yet so thoughtful.",Genuine,99.99
